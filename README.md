## Hello out there ðŸ‘‹

-----
Iâ€™m Michael â€” a UX Designer and creative problem solver with a deep passion for improving peopleâ€™s lives through thoughtful, human-centered design. Currently, I serve as the Director of UX at Medtrics, where I lead our User Experience team in building intuitive, effective tools that are transforming medical education across GME, UME, Nursing, Veterinary, and Allied Health programs.

Design has always been at the heart of my life. What began as a creative passion has evolved into a purposeful career at the intersection of research, usability, and innovation. I hold a Master of Science in UX and Interaction Design from Thomas Jefferson University, where I refined my skills in storyboarding, prototyping, and rapid validation techniques. My professional journey has included graphic and web design, front-end development, and extensive experience with tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, and Axure â€” allowing me to translate ideas into experiences that are both beautiful and functional.

At Medtrics, I bring together my expertise in UX research, usability testing, and prototyping to craft products that truly serve the needs of medical educators and learners. I take pride in being part of a team that is driving innovation in healthcare education, and I thrive on collaborating across disciplines to solve complex problems.

Lately, Iâ€™ve developed a strong interest in AI-assisted design workflows, exploring tools like Cursor and GitHub CLI to enhance prototyping and development processes. I believe that staying curious and adaptable is key to being an effective designer in today's fast-changing tech landscape.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a lover of the arts and enjoy expressing myself through photography and visual storytelling. Youâ€™ll often find me at museums, experimenting with new tech, or spending time with family and friends.
